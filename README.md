## CSV Data
Contains the CSV data related to the games charted from last year. This is meant to be updated once we chart the games with the new software from XOS. To read more up on 


## docs
Contains code related to the automatic documentation building for our classes using sphinx.


## utilities
Contains two Jupyter notebooks with work on SVM and webscrapping capabilities for ACC rosters.



**SVM Initial Work:**

The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to provide a scratch workspace for manipulating the data from the CSV's given by the softball team. The end goal of this notebook is to develop a successful script for running a SVM model on an umpire or whatever factor we decide on.

The notebook can be found [here](/utilities/SVM_initial_work.ipynb)

**WebScrappingWork:**
The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to provide a space to webscrape rosters down for ACC opponents. Many teams in the ACC have the same format for their websites. This makes it very easy to scrape an up to date roster for the team. The code in this notebook is preset for the general format although there might need to be minor changes to it in order for it to work. To denote the user input sections look for the boxed input sections.
